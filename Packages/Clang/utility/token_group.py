    Tokens are allocated from libclang in chunks. They must be disposed of as a

    tokens. Each token in a group contains a reference back to an instance of
    this class. When all tokens from a group are garbage collected, it allows
    this class to be garbage collected. When this class is garbage collected,
    it calls the libclang destructor which invalidates all tokens in the group.
